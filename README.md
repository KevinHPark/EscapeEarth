# Escape Earth
- Escape a world ruined by pollution

## Levels
- [Level 1](docs/Level1.md)
- TBD, basically we launch the first level and see how people like it
- Tasks in full game are collecting garbage and upcycling it into parts for a space ship

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands
`cd dist`
`npx serve .`

## Writing Code
- Right now all the rollup stuff is broken by incompatiblity with dialog plugin... alpha release probably won't include this unfortunately... so i'm stuck in Js for now...
- Look at dist/ for now...

## Deploy to Netlify
- Merge to main (soon to be protected by PR policy...)
